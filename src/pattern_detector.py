DECISION RULES — APPLY IN THIS EXACT ORDER
=====================================================================

STEP 1: Does the LEFT-SIDE contain "LAP TO" in floor labels?
→ YES → RETURN 9

STEP 2: Does the page have a simple 2-column table: COLUMN MARK | SIZES (no reinforcement)?
→ YES → RETURN 7

STEP 3: Does the header contain FOOTING MARK + R.C.C.FOOTING SIZE + PEDESTAL SIZE + BASEMENT FLOOR COLUMN?
→ YES → RETURN 8

STEP 4: Does the header contain COLUMN ID + SIZE OF COLUMN (a, b) + NOS. + GRID REFERENCE + TOP OF COLUMN?
→ YES → RETURN 4

STEP 5: Does the header contain CROSS SECTION OF COLUMN (as a column header with drawn diagrams inside rows)?
→ YES → RETURN 5

STEP 6: Does the LEFT SIDE contain "COLUMN FROM ... TO ..." labels with elevation drawings (not cross-sections)?
→ YES → RETURN 6

STEP 7: Are there cross-section drawings AND the summary table at the bottom contains d1, d2, PEDESTAL rows?
→ YES → RETURN 3

STEP 8: Does the header contain COLUMN MARKED + FOOTING TO GROUND FLOOR + GROUND FLOOR TO FIRST FLOOR + FIRST FLOOR TO ROOF LEVEL (text only, no drawings in cells)?
→ YES → RETURN 2

STEP 9: Does SIZE data appear with inline TYPE codes like "(TYPE-10)", "(TYPE-15)" etc.?
→ YES → RETURN 10

STEP 10: Are there 3 floor rows (GROUND/FIRST/ROOF) with detailed cross-section drawings AND "COLUMN MARKED" at the bottom?
→ YES → RETURN 14

STEP 11: Does the LEFT COLUMN contain floor-level names as ROW LABELS (like "ABOVE TERRACE LEVEL", "4TH FLOOR LEVEL") AND the top has TYPE-grouped or column-grouped headers?
→ YES — but now check the DATA CELLS:
   • If the data cells contain ONLY TEXT/NUMBERS (sizes like "700x700", steel like "20-T25") with NO drawn boxes/diagrams → RETURN 1
   • If the data cells contain cross-section DRAWINGS (rectangular boxes with rebar dots inside) → do NOT return 1, continue to STEP 12

STEP 12: Does the page show a large grid where COLUMN NAMES (C1, C2, C3... or SW1, SW2...) span the TOP and FLOOR LEVELS span the LEFT, with cross-section DRAWINGS inside every cell?
→ YES, column names are regular C1/C2/C3A type → RETURN 11
→ YES, column names are SW (shear walls) or irregular complex shapes → RETURN 13

STEP 13: Does the LEFT SIDE show floor labels containing "(MIX: M260)" or "(MIX: M250)" or "TH FLOOR ROOFTOP" stacked top-to-bottom, with cross-section drawings in each row?
→ YES → RETURN 12

→ NONE OF THE ABOVE → RETURN 13
